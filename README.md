# Utility Performance Dashboard

### Project Overview
The Utility Performance Dashboard is a data visualization project built in Power BI, aimed at simulating performance monitoring for a utility company. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as energy consumption, outage frequency and duration, and customer satisfaction levels. This project provides hands-on experience in data visualization, performance tracking, and reportingâ€”all relevant to roles in utilities and performance monitoring.

### Features
- Interactive dashboard with filters for time periods and locations
- Visualizations to display energy consumption trends, outage statistics, and customer satisfaction levels
- KPI indicators with conditional formatting to highlight key metrics
- Simulated datasets representing typical utility performance data

### Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation within Power BI
- **Public Datasets**: Used to simulate real-world utility performance data

### Project Setup

1. **Install Power BI Desktop**  
   Download and install Power BI Desktop from [Power BI Desktop Download](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/). Power BI Desktop is free and available for Windows, and it will be the primary tool used to build the dashboard.

2. **Create a Project Folder**  
   Set up a folder on your local machine to store project files, datasets, and related documentation. Suggested folder structure:

### Datasets
The following datasets are used, saved as CSV files in the `data/` folder:

1. **Energy Consumption and Generation**  
- **Source**: [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php)
- **Fields**: Date, Location, Consumption (kWh), Generation (kWh)

2. **Customer Satisfaction**  
- **Source**: Simulated data
- **Fields**: Date, Location, Satisfaction Score (1-10)

3. **Power Outages**  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Power Outage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wri/global-power-plant-database)
- **Fields**: Date, Location, Duration (hours), Cause of Outage
