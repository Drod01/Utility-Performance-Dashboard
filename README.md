# ⚡ Utility Performance Dashboard

This Utility Performance Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to visualize and monitor key performance metrics for utility companies. It includes analytics for **energy consumption**, **power outages**, and **customer satisfaction** across different regions over time.

> Built by [David Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-i-rodriguez/), this project reflects practical experience from utility-based performance monitoring and data automation gained during his internship at CPS Energy.

- 📈 Interactive time-series charts for energy consumption
- 🔌 Visual breakdown of outage durations and affected users
- 🌟 Gauge metrics for regional customer satisfaction
- 📍 Filterable by region and timeframe
- 🚀 Built with Power BI, using simulated CSV datasets
